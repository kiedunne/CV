<h3 align='center'>I'm a full-stack developer and previous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoFLlc54HA">award winning</a> psychology and neuroscience researcher that is passionate about design and well-tested, maintainable code.</h3> 

After spending the last decade working in many different realms of psychiatric and neuroscience research, including; spinal cord injury, neuroimaging, and drug addiction, I learnt how to code at Makers Academy, a dev bootcamp specialising in Ruby, Rails, Javascript, TDD and agile methodologies.

I'm looking for a junior developer role within a diverse, fast-paced team who are as passionate about creating unique digital products as I am.

#### Quick Learner 
In every lab I've worked or studied in, I've had to rapidly pick up new skills in different disciplines, ranging from neuroimaging techniques to patient research. While at Makers, I picked up multiple languages and fundamental design principles such as object-oriented programming at a similar rapid pace, all while teaching myself React and Adobe Xd to further explore front-end development and web design.

#### Adaptable
Filling many different roles while working on academic projects, such as researcher, manager and data scientist, has made me very quick to adapt to the needs of the project and my team. During our group engineering projects at Makers, I took on many roles across the entire product cycle, such as sketching out and implementing UI designs, testing back-end controllers or managing continuous integration and deployment. 

#### Creative
I'm a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cE2pHIq6zSPubQbeUXKMxd23bLfuOAN3">visual artist</a>, I love creating unique compositions that challenge expectations with color and form. I approach every project I work on with this same enthusiasm to embrace alternative solutions to technical problems. 

#### Communication and Facilitation
My years of experience working with commissioners, researchers, students, and patients has given me skills in communicating solutions to complex problems in a succinct manner to audiences of various backgrounds. While working on our engineering projects at Makers, I often led the stand-ups and assigned tasks to each team member on our Trello boards, as well as assigned difficulty and time estimations.
