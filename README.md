<h3 align='center'>I'm a full-stack developer and previous neuroscience researcher that has a passion for design and wel-tested, sustainable code.</h3>

After spending the last decade working in many different realms of psychiatric and neuroscience research, including; spinal cord injury, psychiatric neuroimaging, and drug addiction, I learnt how to code at <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/">Makers Academy</a>, a dev bootcamp specializing in Ruby, Rails, Javascript, TDD and agile methodologies.

I'm looking for a Junior Developer role with a team who are just as passionate about clean and sustainable code and creating digital products that make the world a better place.

#### Research
A scientist from day 1, I incorporate the scientific method into how I solve any problem. I've spent the last decade thoroughly understanding complex biological and psychological processes and developing new project ideas that turn into <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jacklyn_Dunne2/research">papers, posters or presentations.</a>

#### Data Analysis
I'm a big believer in using data to shape the direction of a project, be it building a slick app or implementing a novel treatment for patients. I have led and contributed to many projects that used data to gain insights into a psychological or neurological problem I've used R, SPSS and STATA to understand trends in all kinds of data- from a database of alcohol and smoking trends in the UK to the recovery outcomes of spinal cord injury patients.

#### Facilitation and Training
Every role in research I've had has involved breaking down complex subjects and analysis techniques into succinct points and communicating to audiences of various backgrounds. I have led training sessions for staff on interacting with patients and data collection as well as supervised masters students.
