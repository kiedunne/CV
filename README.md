<h3 align='center'>I'm a full-stack developer and previous neuroscience researcher that has a passion for design and well-tested, maintainable code.</h3>

After spending the last decade working in many different realms of psychiatric and neuroscience research, including; spinal cord injury, neuroimaging, and drug addiction, I learnt how to code at <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/">Makers Academy</a>, a dev bootcamp specializing in Ruby, Rails, Javascript, TDD and agile methodologies.

I'm looking for a junior developer role within a fast-paced team that vales who are passionate creating digital products that make the world a better place.

#### Quick Learner 
In every lab I've worked or studied in I've had to rapidly pick up new tehcniques in domains from neuroimaging to patient assessments. While at Makers, I picked up multiple languages and fundamental design principles such as object-oriented programming at a rapid pace, all while teaching myself React and Adobe Xd to further explore front-end development and web design.

### Adaptable
Filling many diferent roles while working on academic projects, such as researcher, trial manager or data scientist, has made me very quick to adapt to the needs of the project and my team. During our group engineering projects at Makers, I took on many roles....

#### Creative
Being a fine , and having a keeen interest in graphic design has 

#### Data Analysis
I have led and contributed to many projects that used data to gain insights into a psychological I've used R, SPSS and STATA to understand trends in all kinds of data- from a database of alcohol and smoking trends in the UK to the recovery outcomes of spinal cord injury patients.

#### Communication and Facilitation
My years of experience working with commissioners, researchers, and patients to deliver solutions to various problems in healthcare delivery has also given me many client-side skills I think would be especially helpful in a consulting environment.

Every role in research I've had has involved breaking down complex subjects and analysis techniques into succinct points and communicating to audiences of various backgrounds. I have led training sessions for staff on interacting with patients and data collection as well as supervised masters students.
